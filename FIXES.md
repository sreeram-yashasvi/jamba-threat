# RunPod Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix issues with the Jamba Threat Detection model deployment on RunPod.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Model Architecture Inconsistency**
   - Problem: Different model architecture implementations across files led to serialization issues
   - Fix: Standardized the model architecture in `src/jamba_model.py` with fixed embedding dimensions and deterministic initialization

2. **Model Serialization Issues**
   - Problem: Non-deterministic model behavior caused serialization mismatches
   - Fix: Added seed setting for reproducible results and proper model serialization/deserialization

3. **Environment Variables and Path Configuration**
   - Problem: Missing or improperly accessed environment variables
   - Fix: Enhanced environment variable handling with defaults and better path configuration

4. **Import Path Resolution**
   - Problem: Module imports failing in different environments
   - Fix: Improved sys.path handling with fallback mechanisms and explicit error reporting

5. **Container Startup Validation**
   - Problem: No validation of container environment before handler startup
   - Fix: Added comprehensive startup validation script (`src/startup_check.sh`) to check dependencies and environment

6. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**
   - Problem: Insufficient logging made troubleshooting difficult
   - Fix: Added detailed logging throughout the codebase, particularly for model initialization and prediction

7. **RunPod Entry Script Improvements**
   - Problem: Basic entry script with limited diagnostics
   - Fix: Enhanced RunPod entry script with better environment setup and diagnostics

8. **Model Configuration Compatibility**
   - Problem: Inconsistent model configuration between `src/jamba/jamba_model.py` and `src/handler.py`
   - Fix: Updated handler.py to use the ModelConfig class from jamba/model_config.py

9. **Fixed RunPod Command Issues**
   - Problem: RunPod command not found in container environment
   - Fix: Added fix_runpod_command.py utility to ensure proper installation and path configuration

10. **Hardcoded Job ID in check_status.py**
    - Problem: check_status.py contains a hardcoded job ID
    - Fix: Modified to accept job ID as a command-line argument

## Key Files Modified

- `src/jamba/jamba_model.py`: Standardized model architecture with deterministic initialization
- `src/handler.py`: Improved error handling, model loading, and environment variable handling
- `src/runpod_entry.sh`: Enhanced entry script with better environment setup and diagnostics
- `src/startup_check.sh`: New validation script to verify container environment
- `src/runpod_verify.py`: Verification tool for deployment checks
- `src/fix_runpod_command.py`: Utility to fix RunPod command issues
- `check_status.py`: Updated to accept job ID as a command-line argument

## Verification

The deployment can be verified using the `src/runpod_verify.py` script, which checks:

1. Model structure compatibility
2. Model serialization consistency
3. Environment variable configuration
4. RunPod endpoint connectivity

Run verification with:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export RUNPOD_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID="your-endpoint-id"

# Run verification
python src/runpod_verify.py
```

## Remaining TODOs

1. Update Dockerfile to properly install dependencies and copy model files
2. Update documentation for environment variable requirements
3. Create cloud deployment automation to streamline the deployment process

## Conclusion

These fixes address the core issues causing the RunPod deployment to fail. The model architecture is now consistent, environment handling is robust, and the container startup process includes comprehensive validation. These changes should ensure reliable operation in the RunPod environment.
